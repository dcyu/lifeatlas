    #   ARNs exempted from the control. Each string is expected to be an IAM
    #   principal that follows the pattern
    #   `^arn:(aws|aws-us-gov):(iam|sts)::.+:.+$`
    #
    #   Example:

    #   control. Each string is expected to be a resource ARN.
    #
    #   Example: `["arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name"]`
    #
    # * **ExemptAssumeRoot**: A parameter that lets you choose whether to
    #   exempt requests made with `AssumeRoot` from this control, for this
    #   OU. For member accounts, the `AssumeRoot` property is included in
    #   requests initiated by IAM centralized root access. This parameter
    #   applies only to the `AWS-GR_RESTRICT_ROOT_USER` control. If you add
    #   the parameter when enabling the control, the `AssumeRoot` exemption
    #   is allowed. If you omit the parameter, the `AssumeRoot` exception is
    #   not permitted. The parameter does not accept `False` as a value.
