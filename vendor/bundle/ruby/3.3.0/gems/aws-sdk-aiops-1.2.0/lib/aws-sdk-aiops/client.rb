    #   @param [Hash] options
    #
    #   @option options [Array<Seahorse::Client::Plugin>] :plugins ([]])
    #     A list of plugins to apply to the client. Each plugin is either a
    #     class name or an instance of a plugin class.
    #
    #   @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #     Your AWS credentials used for authentication. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #     following classes:
    #
    #     * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #       credentials.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading static credentials from a
    #       shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleWebIdentityCredentials` - Used when you need to
    #       assume a role after providing credentials via the web.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SSOCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from AWS SSO using an
    #       access token generated from `aws login`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ProcessCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #       process that outputs to stdout.
    #
    #     * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ECSCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from
    #       instances running in ECS.
    #
    #     * `Aws::CognitoIdentityCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from the Cognito Identity service.
    #
    #     When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #     locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #
    #     * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, `:session_token`, and
    #       `:account_id` options.
    #
    #     * `ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID']`, `ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']`,
    #       `ENV['AWS_SESSION_TOKEN']`, and `ENV['AWS_ACCOUNT_ID']`.
    #
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #
    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #
    #     * EC2/ECS IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts
    #       are very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #       `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` or `Aws::ECSCredentials` to
    #       enable retries and extended timeouts. Instance profile credential
    #       fetching can be disabled by setting `ENV['AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED']`
    #       to `true`.
    #
    #   @option options [required, String] :region
    #     The AWS region to connect to.  The configured `:region` is

    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:region]`
    #     * `ENV['AWS_REGION']`
    #     * `ENV['AMAZON_REGION']`
    #     * `ENV['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION']`

    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :adaptive_retry_wait_to_fill (true)
    #     Used only in `adaptive` retry mode.  When true, the request will sleep
    #     until there is sufficent client side capacity to retry the request.
    #     When false, the request will raise a `RetryCapacityNotAvailableError` and will
    #     not retry instead of sleeping.
    #
    #   @option options [Array<String>] :auth_scheme_preference
    #     A list of preferred authentication schemes to use when making a request. Supported values are:

    #   @option options [Integer] :max_attempts (3)
    #     An integer representing the maximum number attempts that will be made for
    #     a single request, including the initial attempt.  For example,
    #     setting this value to 5 will result in a request being retried up to
    #     4 times. Used in `standard` and `adaptive` retry modes.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :profile ("default")
    #     Used when loading credentials from the shared credentials file at `HOME/.aws/credentials`.
    #     When not specified, 'default' is used.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :request_checksum_calculation ("when_supported")
    #     Determines when a checksum will be calculated for request payloads. Values are:
    #
    #     * `when_supported` - (default) When set, a checksum will be
    #       calculated for all request payloads of operations modeled with the
    #       `httpChecksum` trait where `requestChecksumRequired` is `true` and/or a
    #       `requestAlgorithmMember` is modeled.
    #     * `when_required` - When set, a checksum will only be calculated for
    #       request payloads of operations modeled with the  `httpChecksum` trait where

    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_limit (3)
    #     The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #     ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #     are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #     checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors, auth errors,
    #     endpoint discovery, and errors from expired credentials.
    #     This option is only used in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_max_delay (0)
    #     The maximum number of seconds to delay between retries (0 for no limit)
    #     used by the default backoff function. This option is only used in the

    #
    #     * `adaptive` - An experimental retry mode that includes all the
    #       functionality of `standard` mode along with automatic client side
    #       throttling.  This is a provisional mode that may change behavior
    #       in the future.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :sdk_ua_app_id
    #     A unique and opaque application ID that is appended to the
    #     User-Agent header as app/sdk_ua_app_id. It should have a

    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :stub_responses (false)
    #     Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #     fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #     the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #     {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #     ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #     requests are made, and retries are disabled.
    #
    #   @option options [Aws::Telemetry::TelemetryProviderBase] :telemetry_provider (Aws::Telemetry::NoOpTelemetryProvider)
    #     Allows you to provide a telemetry provider, which is used to
    #     emit telemetry data. By default, uses `NoOpTelemetryProvider` which
    #     will not record or emit any telemetry data. The SDK supports the
    #     following telemetry providers:
    #
    #     * OpenTelemetry (OTel) - To use the OTel provider, install and require the
    #     `opentelemetry-sdk` gem and then, pass in an instance of a

    #       tokens.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SSOTokenProvider` - Used for loading tokens from AWS SSO using an
    #       access token generated from `aws login`.
    #
    #     When `:token_provider` is not configured directly, the `Aws::TokenProviderChain`
    #     will be used to search for tokens configured for your profile in shared configuration files.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :use_dualstack_endpoint
    #     When set to `true`, dualstack enabled endpoints (with `.aws` TLD)
    #     will be used if available.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :use_fips_endpoint
    #     When set to `true`, fips compatible endpoints will be used if available.

    #   @option options [Float] :http_continue_timeout (1)
    #     The number of seconds to wait for a 100-continue response before sending the
    #     request body.  This option has no effect unless the request has "Expect"
    #     header set to "100-continue".  Defaults to `nil` which  disables this
    #     behaviour.  This value can safely be set per request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_idle_timeout (5)
    #     The number of seconds a connection is allowed to sit idle before it
    #     is considered stale.  Stale connections are closed and removed from the
    #     pool before making a request.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_open_timeout (15)
    #     The default number of seconds to wait for response data.

    #   @option options [Proc] :on_chunk_received
    #     When a Proc object is provided, it will be used as callback when each chunk
    #     of the response body is received. It provides three arguments: the chunk,
    #     the number of bytes received, and the total number of
    #     bytes in the response (or nil if the server did not send a `content-length`).
    #
    #   @option options [Proc] :on_chunk_sent
    #     When a Proc object is provided, it will be used as callback when each chunk
    #     of the request body is sent. It provides three arguments: the chunk,
    #     the number of bytes read from the body, and the total number of
    #     bytes in the body.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :raise_response_errors (true)
    #     When `true`, response errors are raised.

    # @!group API Operations

    # Creates an *investigation group* in your account. Creating an
    # investigation group is a one-time setup task for each Region in your
    # account. It is a necessary task to be able to perform investigations.
    #
    # Settings in the investigation group help you centrally manage the
    # common properties of your investigations, such as the following:
    #
    # * Who can access the investigations
    #
    # * Whether investigation data is encrypted with a customer managed Key
    #   Management Service key.
    #
    # * How long investigations and their data are retained by default.
    #
    # Currently, you can have one investigation group in each Region in your
    # account. Each investigation in a Region is a part of the investigation
    # group in that Region
    #
    # To create an investigation group and set up CloudWatch investigations,
    # you must be signed in to an IAM principal that has the either the
    # `AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy` or the `AdministratorAccess` IAM policy
    # attached, or to an account that has similar permissions.
    #
    # You can configure CloudWatch alarms to start investigations and add
    # events to investigations. If you create your investigation group with
    # `CreateInvestigationGroup` and you want to enable alarms to do this,
    # you must use [PutInvestigationGroupPolicy][1] to create a resource
    # policy that grants this permission to CloudWatch alarms.
    #
    #  For more information about configuring CloudWatch alarms to work with
    # CloudWatch investigations, see
    #
    #
    #
    # [1]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/operationalinvestigations/latest/AmazonQDeveloperOperationalInvestigationsAPIReference/API_PutInvestigationGroupPolicy.html
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :name
    #   Provides a name for the investigation group.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :role_arn
    #   Specify the ARN of the IAM role that CloudWatch investigations will
    #   use when it gathers investigation data. The permissions in this role
    #   determine which of your resources that CloudWatch investigations will
    #   have access to during investigations.
    #
    #   For more information, see [How to control what data Amazon Q has
    #   access to during investigations][1].

    #
    # @option params [Types::EncryptionConfiguration] :encryption_configuration
    #   Use this structure if you want to use a customer managed KMS key to
    #   encrypt your investigation data. If you omit this parameter,
    #   CloudWatch investigations will use an Amazon Web Services key to
    #   encrypt the data. For more information, see [Encryption of
    #   investigation data][1].
    #
    #
    #
    #   [1]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Investigations-Security.html#Investigations-KMS
    #
    # @option params [Integer] :retention_in_days
    #   Specify how long that investigation data is kept. For more
    #   information, see [Operational investigation data retention][1].
    #
    #   If you omit this parameter, the default of 90 days is used.

    #
    # @option params [Hash<String,String>] :tags
    #   A list of key-value pairs to associate with the investigation group.
    #   You can associate as many as 50 tags with an investigation group. To
    #   be able to associate tags when you create the investigation group, you
    #   must have the `cloudwatch:TagResource` permission.
    #
    #   Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also
    #   use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to
    #   access or change only resources with certain tag values.
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :tag_key_boundaries
    #   Enter the existing custom tag keys for custom applications in your
    #   system. Resource tags help Amazon Q narrow the search space when it is
    #   unable to discover definite relationships between resources. For
    #   example, to discover that an Amazon ECS service depends on an Amazon
    #   RDS database, Amazon Q can discover this relationship using data
    #   sources such as X-Ray and CloudWatch Application Signals. However, if
    #   you haven't deployed these features, Amazon Q will attempt to
    #   identify possible relationships. Tag boundaries can be used to narrow
    #   the resources that will be discovered by Amazon Q in these cases.
    #
    #   You don't need to enter tags created by myApplications or
    #   CloudFormation, because Amazon Q can automatically detect those tags.
    #
    # @option params [Hash<String,Array>] :chatbot_notification_channel
    #   Use this structure to integrate CloudWatch investigations with Amazon
    #   Q in chat applications. This structure is a string array. For the
    #   first string, specify the ARN of an Amazon SNS topic. For the array of
    #   strings, specify the ARNs of one or more Amazon Q in chat applications
    #   configurations that you want to associate with that topic. For more
    #   information about these configuration ARNs, see [Getting started with
    #   Amazon Q in chat applications][1] and [Resource type defined by Amazon
    #   Web Services Chatbot][2].

    # @option params [required, String] :identifier
    #   Specify either the name or the ARN of the investigation group that you
    #   want to modify.
    #
    # @option params [String] :role_arn
    #   Specify this field if you want to change the IAM role that CloudWatch
    #   investigations will use when it gathers investigation data. To do so,
    #   specify the ARN of the new role.
    #
    #   The permissions in this role determine which of your resources that
    #   CloudWatch investigations will have access to during investigations.

    # @option params [Types::EncryptionConfiguration] :encryption_configuration
    #   Use this structure if you want to use a customer managed KMS key to
    #   encrypt your investigation data. If you omit this parameter,
    #   CloudWatch investigations will use an Amazon Web Services key to
    #   encrypt the data. For more information, see [Encryption of
    #   investigation data][1].

    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :tag_key_boundaries
    #   Enter the existing custom tag keys for custom applications in your
    #   system. Resource tags help Amazon Q narrow the search space when it is
    #   unable to discover definite relationships between resources. For
    #   example, to discover that an Amazon ECS service depends on an Amazon
    #   RDS database, Amazon Q can discover this relationship using data
    #   sources such as X-Ray and CloudWatch Application Signals. However, if
    #   you haven't deployed these features, Amazon Q will attempt to
    #   identify possible relationships. Tag boundaries can be used to narrow
    #   the resources that will be discovered by Amazon Q in these cases.
    #
    #   You don't need to enter tags created by myApplications or
    #   CloudFormation, because Amazon Q can automatically detect those tags.
    #
    # @option params [Hash<String,Array>] :chatbot_notification_channel
    #   Use this structure to integrate CloudWatch investigations with Amazon
    #   Q in chat applications. This structure is a string array. For the
    #   first string, specify the ARN of an Amazon SNS topic. For the array of
    #   strings, specify the ARNs of one or more Amazon Q in chat applications
    #   configurations that you want to associate with that topic. For more
    #   information about these configuration ARNs, see [Getting started with
    #   Amazon Q in chat applications][1] and [Resource type defined by Amazon
    #   Web Services Chatbot][2].
