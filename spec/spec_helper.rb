# This file was generated by the `rails generate rspec:install` command. Conventionally, all

# this file to always be loaded, without a need to explicitly require it in any
# files.

# Given that it is always loaded, you are encouraged to keep this file as
# light-weight as possible. Requiring only the support files necessary.
